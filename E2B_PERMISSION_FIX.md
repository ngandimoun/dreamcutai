# E2B Permission Fix

## Issue Identified
The E2B sandbox creation was successful, but the dependency installation was failing with permission errors:

```
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to lock directory /var/lib/apt/lists/
```

## Root Cause
The `apt-get` commands were being run without `sudo` privileges, which is required for package installation in the E2B sandbox environment.

## Solution Applied

### âœ… Added sudo to apt-get commands
```typescript
// Before (missing sudo)
apt-get update -y && 
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip portaudio19-dev sox libsox-fmt-all gettext && 
pip3 install --upgrade "manim-voiceover[elevenlabs]" manim==0.18.1

// After (with sudo)
sudo apt-get update -y && 
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip portaudio19-dev sox libsox-fmt-all gettext && 
pip3 install --upgrade "manim-voiceover[elevenlabs]" manim==0.18.1
```

## E2B Sandbox Environment

### Key Insights:
- **Root Access**: E2B sandboxes run as root by default, but apt operations still require explicit `sudo`
- **Package Installation**: System packages need `sudo apt-get` for installation
- **Python Packages**: `pip3` can run without sudo for user-level installation
- **File Operations**: File writes and reads work without sudo

### Command Structure:
```bash
# System packages (requires sudo)
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y package_name

# Python packages (no sudo needed)
pip3 install package_name
```

## Expected Results

The system should now:
- âœ… **Create E2B sandbox** successfully
- âœ… **Install system dependencies** with proper sudo privileges
- âœ… **Install Python packages** (Manim, manim-voiceover)
- âœ… **Render the animation** without permission errors
- âœ… **Upload the video** to Supabase Storage

## Testing

The system should now work without the permission errors. The sandbox creation should succeed and proceed to:
1. Install system dependencies with sudo
2. Install Python packages with pip3
3. Render the Manim animation
4. Upload the video

## Next Steps

1. **Test the API** with a simple prompt
2. **Monitor the logs** to see if dependency installation succeeds
3. **Check if Manim rendering** completes successfully
4. **Verify video upload** to Supabase Storage

The E2B permission issue should now be resolved! ðŸŽ‰
