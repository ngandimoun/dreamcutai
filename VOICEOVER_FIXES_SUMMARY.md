# Voiceover System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Python Loop Variable Bug (modal_functions/manim_render.py)
**Problem**: Line 175 was using undefined variable `i` in the fallback code generation loop.

**Fix**: Changed `for line in lines:` to `for i, line in enumerate(lines):` to properly define the loop index variable.

**Impact**: Prevents `name 'i' is not defined` error that was causing render failures.

---

### 2. Transcription Package Dependency (lib/manim/claude-prompts.ts)
**Problem**: OpenAIService was trying to enable transcription by default, which requires `whisper` and `stable_whisper` packages that aren't installed in the Modal container. This caused interactive prompts asking to install packages, which fails in non-interactive environments.

**Fix**: Added `transcription_model=None` parameter to OpenAIService initialization:
```python
self.set_speech_service(OpenAIService(
    voice="${voiceName}", 
    model="gpt-4o-mini-tts", 
    transcription_model=None
))
```

**Impact**: Disables transcription feature, avoiding package dependency issues and interactive prompts.

### 3. Scene Name Detection (modal_functions/manim_render.py)
**Problem**: The scene name passed to the render function might not match the actual class name in the generated code, causing "WhatIsScene is not in the script" errors.

**Fix**: Added automatic scene name detection before rendering:
```python
# Validate that the scene name exists in the code
if f"class {scene_name}" not in code:
    print(f"⚠️ Warning: Scene name '{scene_name}' not found in code")
    # Try to extract the actual scene name from the code
    scene_match = re.search(r'class\s+(\w+)\s*\(\s*(?:Voiceover)?Scene\s*\)', code)
    if scene_match:
        detected_name = scene_match.group(1)
        print(f"   Detected scene name: '{detected_name}'")
        scene_name = detected_name
```

**Impact**: Automatically corrects scene name mismatches, reducing render failures.

---

### 4. Self-Healing Code Generation (lib/manim/self-healing.ts)
**Problem**: The retry logic wasn't passing the previous code to the AI for error correction, so it kept generating the same buggy code repeatedly.

**Fix**: 
- Added `previousCode` parameter to `generateManimCode()` function
- Pass previous code to `getFixOnFailPrompt()` so AI can see what failed
- Updated retry loop to pass previous code on subsequent attempts

**Impact**: AI can now actually fix errors by seeing what went wrong, making the self-healing more effective.

## Additional Improvements

### 5. Prompt Length Limit Increased
- Increased from 2000 to 5000 characters in all API routes
- Added character counter to UI with color-coded warnings
- Supports detailed educational prompts

### 6. Voice System Updates
- All 11 OpenAI voices available in UI (alloy, ash, ballad, coral, echo, fable, onyx, nova, sage, shimmer, verse)
- Using `gpt-4o-mini-tts` model
- Default voice changed to "fable"

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Fixed Python loop bug
- [x] Disabled transcription to avoid package issues
- [x] Added scene name auto-detection
- [x] Improved self-healing with previous code context
- [x] Increased prompt length limit
- [x] Updated voice system with all OpenAI voices

## Expected Behavior Now

1. ✅ Voiceover generation works without transcription package errors
2. ✅ Scene name mismatches are automatically corrected
3. ✅ Self-healing actually fixes code by learning from previous errors
4. ✅ No more `name 'i' is not defined` errors
5. ✅ Longer prompts (up to 5000 chars) are supported
6. ✅ All 11 OpenAI voices are available for selection

## Files Modified

1. `modal_functions/manim_render.py` - Fixed loop bug, added scene name detection
2. `lib/manim/claude-prompts.ts` - Disabled transcription, added critical note
3. `lib/manim/self-healing.ts` - Pass previous code to retry attempts
4. `app/api/explainers/generate/route.ts` - Increased prompt limit, better validation
5. `components/explainer-generator-interface.tsx` - Added character counter, all voices

---

## Next Steps

The system should now properly:
1. Generate voiceover-enabled animations with OpenAI TTS
2. Handle errors more intelligently with self-healing
3. Auto-detect and correct scene name mismatches
4. Support detailed prompts for complex educational content

Try generating an explainer with voiceover enabled - the errors should be resolved!
