# Charts & Infographics: Pass Data File to Modal Fix

## Problem
When users uploaded data files (Excel, JSON, CSV), the chart generation failed with:
```
❌ Modal chart execution failed: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/mnt/data/sales_data.xlsx'
```

## Root Cause
**Two-Phase Architecture Issue:**
1. **Phase 1:** Code Interpreter receives file and generates code like `pd.read_excel('/mnt/data/sales_data.xlsx')`
2. **Phase 2:** Modal tries to execute this code → **FAILS** because file doesn't exist in Modal environment

## Solution: Pass Data File to Modal

**Simple and Direct Approach:** Pass the data file to Modal along with the Python code, allowing Code Interpreter to generate normal file-reading code and Modal to execute it with the file present.

## Implementation

### 1. Updated Modal Function Signature
**File:** `lib/modal/chart-generation.ts`

```typescript
export async function executeChartCode(
  code: string, 
  dataFile?: { buffer: Buffer; filename: string }
): Promise<Buffer>
```

**Changes:**
- Added optional `dataFile` parameter
- Updated request body to include base64-encoded file data
- Added logging for data file inclusion

### 2. Updated Modal Python Function
**File:** `modal_functions/chart_render.py`

**Added file handling:**
```python
# Handle data file if provided
data_file_info = request_body.get("dataFile")
if data_file_info:
    # Create /mnt/data directory
    os.makedirs('/mnt/data', exist_ok=True)
    
    # Decode base64 file data
    file_buffer = base64.b64decode(data_file_info["buffer"])
    filename = data_file_info["filename"]
    file_path = f'/mnt/data/{filename}'
    
    # Save file to /mnt/data/
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(file_buffer)
```

**Changes:**
- Added `os` import for directory creation
- Added data file handling before code execution
- Creates `/mnt/data/` directory if needed
- Saves uploaded file with original filename
- Error handling for file operations

### 3. Updated API Route
**File:** `app/api/charts-infographics/route.ts`

```typescript
const chartImageBuffer = await executeChartCode(
  chartCodeResult.pythonCode,
  dataFileBuffer ? { buffer: dataFileBuffer, filename: dataFile.name } : undefined
)
```

**Changes:**
- Pass data file buffer and filename to Modal
- Only passes file if data file was uploaded

### 4. Reverted Prompt Changes
**File:** `lib/utils/chart-prompt-builder.ts`

**Removed:**
- Self-contained code instructions
- Data embedding requirements
- File reading prohibitions

**Why:** Code Interpreter can now generate normal file-reading code since Modal has access to the files.

## How It Works Now

### Data Flow:
1. **User uploads file** → API receives file buffer
2. **Code Interpreter** → Receives file, generates normal code with file paths
3. **API** → Passes both code and file buffer to Modal
4. **Modal** → Saves file to `/mnt/data/`, executes code successfully
5. **Result** → Chart generated with real data

### Example:
**Code Interpreter generates:**
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_excel('/mnt/data/sales_data.xlsx')  # ✅ File exists in Modal
plt.bar(df['Product'], df['Sales'])
```

**Modal execution:**
1. Saves `sales_data.xlsx` to `/mnt/data/sales_data.xlsx`
2. Executes the code
3. File path resolves correctly
4. Chart generated successfully

## Benefits

✅ **Simple Solution** - Just pass one more parameter  
✅ **Reliable** - Code Interpreter generates normal code  
✅ **No Prompt Hacking** - Let Code Interpreter work naturally  
✅ **Supports All Files** - Works with Excel, JSON, CSV, PDF, etc.  
✅ **Minimal Changes** - Only 4 files modified  
✅ **Robust** - No complex data embedding logic  

## Testing

The fix resolves:
- ✅ Excel file uploads (.xlsx, .xls)
- ✅ JSON file uploads (.json)
- ✅ CSV file uploads (.csv)
- ✅ All other supported data formats
- ✅ Modal execution with file dependencies
- ✅ Multi-select logo placement (from previous fix)
- ✅ Logo enhancement (from previous fix)

- `lib/modal/chart-generation.ts` - Updated function signature and request handling
- `modal_functions/chart_render.py` - Added file handling and directory creation
- `app/api/charts-infographics/route.ts` - Pass file buffer to Modal
- `lib/utils/chart-prompt-builder.ts` - Reverted to normal prompts

## Summary

This fix ensures that **Modal receives both the Python code and the data file**, allowing Code Interpreter to generate normal file-reading code that executes successfully. The data file is saved to `/mnt/data/` in Modal's environment before code execution, resolving the file path dependency issue.
